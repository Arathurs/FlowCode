  Color selector
  The design team would like to select from a list of colors when creating a Flowcode. When that color is selected, it is then set as the active color for the design.

  Instructions:
  - modify the color component to accept a prop that sets the passed in color as the background color
  - pass a handler to the color component that will set the color as the active color when it is clicked
  - apply a border around the selected color
  - move the colors list to state.
  - update colors list styling to render horizontally with colors wrapping within the container as needed
  - initialize the colors component with 50 random colors
  - Create a 'Reset' button. When this button is clicked state is updated with 50 new colors.
